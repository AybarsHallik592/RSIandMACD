Implementing basics of MACD and RSI by using Python3

-What is RSI?\
+One of the most widely used technical indicators in technical analysis is the **![#1589F0]Relative Strength Index**. It measures the magnitude of recent price evolutions to evaluate if a price of an asset is overbought or oversold.


-What is MACD?\
+The MACD is probably the second most known oscillator after the RSI. One that is heavily followed by traders. It stands for **![#1589F0]Moving Average Convergence Divergence** and it is used mainly for divergences and flips. Many people also consider it a trend-following indicator but others use graphical analysis on it to find reversal points, making the MACD a versatile indicator.

-What is EMA?\
+The **![#1589F0]exponential moving average** (EMA) is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment (like a stock or commodity) over time. The EMA is a type of weighted moving average (WMA) that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data.

-What is SMA?\
+A **simple moving average** (SMA) is an arithmetic moving average calculated by adding recent prices and then dividing that figure by the number of time periods in the calculation average.

-What is RS?\
+**![#1589F0]The relative strength** is a technique that compares the value of a security to another security, index or benchmark. The relative strength can be considered to be part of the value investing system. The relative strength is represented by a ratio. It is derived by dividing the base security by the security, index or benchmark which is to be used for the comparison.
